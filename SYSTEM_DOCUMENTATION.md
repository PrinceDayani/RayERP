• Footnotes should be used sparingly. They should be typed single space and placed directly 
underneath in the very same page, which refers to the material they annotate. 
Appendices – Appendices are provided to give supplementary information, which is included in

given below relates to the citation example quoted above.

## 🔌 API Architecture

### API Design Principles
- RESTful conventions
- Consistent response format
- Proper HTTP status codes
- Pagination for list endpoints
- Filtering and sorting support
- Error handling with meaningful messages

### Standard Response Format
```json
{
  "success": true/false,
  "data": {},
  "message": "string",
  "pagination": {
    "page": 1,
    "limit": 10,
    "total": 100
  }
}
```

### Authentication Flow
1. User sends credentials to `/api/auth/login`
2. Server validates credentials
3. JWT token generated and returned
4. Client stores token
5. Token sent in Authorization header for subsequent requests
6. Server validates token on each request
7. Token expires after configured time
8. Refresh token used to get new access token
